## Using Categories Effectively

### Avoid Over-Classification
- Assign the **primary** category that best describes the root cause
- Many risks span categories; choose the dominant one
- Use sub-categories for more precise classification

### Consider Interconnections
- Strategic risks often manifest as operational or financial impacts
- Technology risks frequently create compliance and reputational exposure
- Document secondary impacts in the risk statement

### Map to Business Objectives
Each category typically relates to organizational objectives:

| Category | Typical Objectives |
|----------|-------------------|
| Strategic | Growth, market position, competitive advantage |
| Operational | Efficiency, quality, reliability, safety |
| Financial | Profitability, liquidity, financial accuracy |
| Compliance | Legal, regulatory, ethical obligations |
| Technology | Data integrity, availability, security |
| Reputational | Stakeholder trust, brand value |
