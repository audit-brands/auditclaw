# Scaling Guidance for Risk Assessment

This document provides guidance on adjusting likelihood and impact scales based on organization size and risk appetite.

## Organization Size Profiles

### Small Organization
- Revenue: <$50M
- Employees: <250
- Geographic scope: Single region

### Medium Organization
- Revenue: $50M-$500M
- Employees: 250-2,500
- Geographic scope: National or limited international

### Large Organization
- Revenue: >$500M
- Employees: >2,500
- Geographic scope: Multinational

## Adjusted Impact Scales

### Financial Impact

| Score | Small Org | Medium Org | Large Org |
|-------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| 1 - Insignificant | <$5K | <$25K | <$100K |
| 2 - Minor | $5K-$25K | $25K-$250K | $100K-$1M |
| 3 - Moderate | $25K-$100K | $250K-$2.5M | $1M-$10M |
| 4 - Major | $100K-$500K | $2.5M-$25M | $10M-$100M |
| 5 - Severe | >$500K | >$25M | >$100M |

### Operational Impact

| Score | Small Org | Medium Org | Large Org |
|-------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| 1 - Insignificant | <4 hours disruption | <1 day disruption | <1 day disruption |
| 2 - Minor | 4-24 hours | 1-3 days | 1-7 days |
| 3 - Moderate | 1-3 days | 3-7 days | 1-4 weeks |
| 4 - Major | 3-7 days | 1-4 weeks | 1-3 months |
| 5 - Severe | >1 week | >1 month | >3 months |

### Reputational Impact

| Score | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| 1 - Insignificant | Internal awareness only | No external complaints |
| 2 - Minor | Limited external awareness | Individual complaints, no media |
| 3 - Moderate | Regional awareness | Local/trade media, social media attention |
| 4 - Major | National awareness | National media, regulatory inquiry |
| 5 - Severe | International awareness | International media, regulatory action, executive accountability |

## Calibration Process

When assessing risks for a specific organization:

1. **Determine organization profile** (small/medium/large)
2. **Identify risk appetite** — Conservative, moderate, or aggressive
3. **Select appropriate scale** from tables above
4. **Document scale selection** in the risk register header
5. **Apply consistently** across all risks in the assessment

## Risk Appetite Adjustments

### Conservative Risk Appetite
- Threshold for "High" risk: Score ≥8
- Threshold for "Critical" risk: Score ≥12
- Requires mitigation: All High and Critical risks

### Moderate Risk Appetite
- Threshold for "High" risk: Score ≥10
- Threshold for "Critical" risk: Score ≥16
- Requires mitigation: All Critical risks, High risks by exception

### Aggressive Risk Appetite
- Threshold for "High" risk: Score ≥12
- Threshold for "Critical" risk: Score ≥20
- Requires mitigation: Critical risks only

## Example Calibration Statement

Include at the top of risk registers:

```
Assessment Calibration:
- Organization Profile: Medium
- Risk Appetite: Moderate
- Financial Impact Scale: Medium Org ($25K / $250K / $2.5M / $25M thresholds)
- Risk Thresholds: High ≥10, Critical ≥16
```
