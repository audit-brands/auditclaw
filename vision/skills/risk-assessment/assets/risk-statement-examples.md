## Risk Statement Checklist

When writing risk statements, verify:

- [ ] Starts with "Risk that..."
- [ ] Includes specific event or condition (what could happen)
- [ ] Includes cause or vulnerability (why it could happen)
- [ ] Includes business consequence (so what)
- [ ] Is specific enough to be actionable
- [ ] Avoids jargon without explanation
- [ ] Could be understood by someone outside the immediate area
- [ ] Suggests what controls might address it

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Example | Problem |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Label instead of statement | "Fraud risk" | Not actionable; no cause or impact |
| Missing cause | "Risk that data is breached, resulting in fines" | Can't design controls without knowing why |
| Missing impact | "Risk that invoices are paid twice due to no duplicate check" | Can't assess severity without consequence |
| Too vague | "Risk that something goes wrong with IT" | Not specific enough to assess or mitigate |
| Too narrow | "Risk that John makes an error on Tuesday" | Too specific; not useful for systematic assessment |
| Stating the control gap | "Risk that we don't have a backup" | Describes absence, not what could happen |
| Combining multiple risks | "Risk that fraud, errors, and system failures occur..." | Assess separately for clear ownership and response |
